<p>Good evening.</p>

<p>Due to the creation of my own theme, my old blog will be deprecated, and will be replaced with a new one.</p>

<p>The newly recreated skin is based on a specific skin from Naver Blog, and since I am having problems registering on it, plus the user base is Korean, I decided to mimic the theme instead. Although it's not a perfect copy (since the skin is still work in progress), it looks like a decent copy of the skin (atleast for me.)</p>

<p>And of course, I modified it to fit my preferences, such as adding Twemoji support on the skin and syntax highlighting to it.</p>

<p>I'm kinda surprised that it was seemingly easy to copy, considering that I am a bit of a noob in web design and double checking my code ðŸ˜…</p>

<p>I also based the skin on other websites, such as <a href="https://xenosium.com">Xenosium</a> and <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh">osu! web</a>, so you may find a bit of the elements similar to these websites (such as the font, and UI design).</p>

<p>Anyway, I have a lot of things to do right now, so I might as well end this entry.</p>
