<p>Since I don't really play Taiko regularly, my rank only increases by hundreds (but atleast I get to be on the top 50 leaderboards on some maps)</p>

<p>I'm not really that good at Taiko since I usually keep missing notes on streams (unless there's a pattern), but since I have been <a href="https://taiko.bui.pm">playing on a website</a> for a long time, I may improved my skills a bit, until I finally figured to play Taiko on my old osu! account instead.</p>

<p>I'm kinda impressed since I didn't expect to reach 5 digits (because like I said, I'm not really that good at Taiko), so might as well improve and if I can, I would try to reach 4 digits.</p>
