<p>Good evening.</p>

<p>After a few days of working on the new skin, I have finished making it.</p>

<p>Like the previous blog skin, it was based on a skin from Blog Naver, with a few changes on it. I never got the chance to finish the previous skin because I was too lazy and that it's too plain, which is why I created a new one instead.</p>

<p>However, unlike the previous one, this new skin took more than 1 day to make due to how hard it is to style it properly, mostly since the new blog skin features a 2-column feature, where the left column redirects you back to the main page, while the right column is where blog information is placed.</p>

<p>I have also improved indentation of the files when the site is being built, by using jekyll-tidy. The downside is that it only supports indentation with 2 spaces instead of 4. But atleast the source code will now be readable.</p>
