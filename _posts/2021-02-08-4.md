<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to write entries on the remaining days last week, since the computer I was using was broken ðŸ˜‘. And since I was planning to create a new update for the website (mostly styling updates), I had no choice but to move the update.</p>

<p>I was also able to realise that I still have many elements left to style properly, but I will work on that to another day, since I still have a lot of things left to do.</p>  

<p>Now that the computer is fixed already, I was finally able to start working on the update, and I was able to improve my osu! skills a bit as well (on Standard mode).</p>
