<h1>About Blog</h1>

<p>&#8216;Tetsu's Diary&#8217; is my personal blog that originally started in December 2020, in order to remove my boredom amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It was originally hosted in 2 popular blogging platforms, which is <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, <a href="https://blog.fc2.com">Blog FC2</a>. However, due to their limitations, I switched to GitHub Pages as the place to manage my blog.</p>

<p>I mostly post random stuff, since this is a personal blog after all.</p>

    <p style="margin: 0;">I never really liked introducing myself, since I prefer keeping secrets from everyone (including my relatives), so my introduction may be incomplete.</p>

    <sub>*I never really leak my real name in the internet frequently, unless I trust that person.</sub>
