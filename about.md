<h2>About Blog</h2>

<p>Tetsu's Blog was originally created in 2020 in an attempt to reduce boredom amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. It was first hosted on <a href="https://blogger.com">Blogger</a>, a blogging platform by Google, then was moved to <a href="https://blog.fc2.com">Blog FC2</a>. However, due to the limitations of these 2 blogging platforms, I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll">Jekyll</a> to manage my blog, and use <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a> to host it.</p>

        I never really liked introducing since most of the information I share is incomplete, but this might enough for an about page.
